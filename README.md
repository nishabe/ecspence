A solution that is meant to help common man to keep track of expenses, analyze it, visualize it and predict the future.
Here is the basic concpet:

This is a solution to analyze, visualize and predict personal expenses.

It should not be limited to personal expense tracking, but for simplicity just assume the type of expenses is as personal.
The input to the system will be monthly bank statements.

Bare minimum use case scenario:

User need to put statements to a specific folder in the pc/mac.
This could be retrieved from bank programmatically, but for simplicity consider the manual option.
There is a script in python that observe the folder
When a file is present, it will start analyzing
There is a set of text files dedicated for learning and converting that learning to CRUD a set of rules.
As an example, statements from ICICI will be different from one that from SBI or BOFA.
Once the analysis is over, the output will be shown via a web page hosted locally
Frame works like d3.js will be used for visualization part

This will be an open source project because, majority of the learning part is based contribution. 
Contributions helps to learn different banking terms and statements around the world.
